# Join our discussion!

If you're a member of [our lab](https://www.context-lab.com/) and/or a [Dartmouth](https://home.dartmouth.edu/) community member, feel free to join our [Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/EQ19QMD6Z/C0753BB4MC5) to discuss daily leetcode problems!

# Submit your own notes and/or solution(s)

1. Start by [forking](https://github.com/ContextLab/leetcode-solutions/fork) this repository.  Or if you've already forked this repository, you should visit your fork and make sure to click the button to sync it up with this (source) repository.
2. In your fork, in the menu near the top click on **Actions** to open up the GitHub Actions list.  Then click on **Create New Note for Daily LeetCode Problem** and then click **Run workflow** to create your new notes file for today's problem. Click the link to the notes on today's problem in the last row of the [table above](https://github.com/ContextLab/leetcode-solutions#problems-weve-attempted-thus-far) and you should see a markdown (.md) file named for your GitHub username.  Edit that to add your notes!
  - If you're the "build-it-yourself" type, it's also OK to create your notes file manually.  Just navigate to the [problems](https://github.com/ContextLab/leetcode-solutions/new/main/problems) folder and click the **Add file** button on the right.  Choose the **Create new file** option:
    - File name: `problems/<PROBLEM NUMBER>/<your name>.md` (where you should replace `<PROBLEM NUMBER>` with the leetcode problem ID code, and `<your name>` with either your first name or your GitHub username (your choice!), in lowercase letters.  E.g., [Jeremy](https://www.context-lab.com/people)'s solution to problem 350 would be named `problems/350/jeremy.md`
    - Contents: Any format is fine, but we suggest starting with our [template file](https://github.com/ContextLab/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/problems/template.md).  Then add your notes/solution as you solve the problem!  Make sure to commit your changes (and it's fine to make multiple commits as you're working on the problem).
3. Once you've added your file(s), start a [pull request](https://github.com/ContextLab/leetcode-solutions/pulls) to add your changes to the ContextLab repository so that others can see how you approached the problem.

# Other stuff

The [table](https://github.com/ContextLab/leetcode-solutions#problems-weve-attempted-thus-far) listing each day's problems and links to our solutions *should* be updated automatically via [this action](https://github.com/ContextLab/leetcode-solutions/actions/workflows/update_readme.yml) (run each day at 00:01 UTC, which is 1 minute after the daily problems are released).  Sometimes it's a little late.

# Question? Comments? Concerns?

You can work through problems "live" in our [Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/EQ19QMD6Z/C0753BB4MC5).  To make comments on a specific solution, make suggestions for this repository in general, etc., consider filing an [issue](https://github.com/ContextLab/leetcode-solutions/issues).
