# Leetcode problems

Each day (ideally) we'll attempt the daily [leetcode](https://leetcode.com) problem.  We'll make a new folder for each day's problem.  Anyone who wants can submit a markdown file, iPython notebook, etc. with their notes, questions, solutions, test cases, or other problem-related files.

# Problems we've attempted thus far:

| Date         | Problem                                                                                                     | Link to notes                                                                                             | Difficulty |

# Join our discussion!

If you're a member of [our lab](https://www.context-lab.com/) and/or a [Dartmouth](https://home.dartmouth.edu/) community member, feel free to join our [Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/EQ19QMD6Z/C0753BB4MC5) to discuss daily leetcode problems!

# Submit your own notes and/or solution(s)

1. Start by [forking](https://github.com/ContextLab/leetcode-solutions/fork) this repository.
2. In your fork, navigate to the [problems](https://github.com/ContextLab/leetcode-solutions/new/main/problems) folder and click the **Add file** button on the right.  Choose the **Create new file** option:
  - File name: `leetcode-solutions/problems/<PROBLEM NUMBER>/<your name>.md` (where you should replace `<PROBLEM NUMBER>` with the leetcode problem ID code, and `<your name>` with your first name, in lowercase letters.  E.g., [Jeremy](https://www.context-lab.com/people)'s solution to problem 350 would be named `leetcode-solutions/blob/main/problems/350/jeremy.md`
  - Contents: Any format is fine, but we suggest starting with our [template file](https://github.com/ContextLab/leetcode-solutions/blob/main/problems/template.md).  Then add your notes/solution as you solve the problem!  Make sure to commit your changes (and it's fine to make multiple commits as you're working on the problem).
3. Once you've added your file, start a [pull request](https://github.com/ContextLab/leetcode-solutions/pulls) to add it into the ContextLab fork so that others can see how you approached the problem.
4. Also make sure that the problem has been added to the [table](https://github.com/ContextLab/leetcode-solutions#problems-weve-attempted-thus-far).  If you're the first one to work on a problem, you'll need to add a row for it.  Problems should be listed in chronological order from top (earliest) to bottom (latest).

# Question? Comments? Concerns?

You can work through problems "live" in our [Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/EQ19QMD6Z/C0753BB4MC5).  To make comments on a specific solution, make suggestions for this repository in general, etc., consider filing an [issue](https://github.com/ContextLab/leetcode-solutions/issues).
