# [Problem 1508: Range Sum of Sorted Subarray Sums](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-sorted-subarray-sums/description/?envType=daily-question)

## Initial thoughts (stream-of-consciousness)
- The "naive" solution would be:
    - Make the set of subarray sums (this takes $O(n^2)$ time and space, where $n$ is the length of the array)
    - Sort the sums (this takes $O(n^2 \log n^2)$ time)
    - Return the sum of the relevant range
- I think the naive solution will be too slow
- I'm wondering if sorting `nums` at the start will be useful:
    - We know that the sets with the smallest sums will contain lower-valued elements
    - I feel like there "should" be a way of generating the subsets' sums in order.  For example, after sorting:
        - The smallest subset will be just the first element
        - The second smallest subset will contain the second number
        - The third subset will contain either:
            - The third number alone OR
            - The first and second numbers (if their sum is smaller than the third number)
        - The fourth subset will contain either:
            - The fourth number alone OR
            - The first and second numbers (if their sum is larger than the third number but smaller than the fourth) OR
            - The first, second, and third numbers (if their sum is smaller than the fourth) OR
            - The first and third numbers OR
            - The second and third numbers
        - And so on.  In general, the $k^{\mathrm{th}}$ subset will be one of the $\frac{k * (k + 1)}{2}$ subsets comprised of numbers from in the sorted array at (1-indexed) positions from $1...k$.  Hmm.
        - Could we enumerate these options systematically?  E.g.:
            - Start looking for subsets of length 1
            - Prioritizing subsets of length 1, check whether any length 2 subset is smaller
                - This requires also checking whether any length 3 subset is smaller, and so on... ðŸ¤”
            - Maybe we could look in sliding windows?
                - Start of sliding window: position `i` (initialize to 0)
                - Intialize `width = 1`
                - Initialize `j = i + width`  (note: I'm thinking of something like taking `sorted_nums[i:j]`...but it's not going to work when `width > 2`...still, let's see if we can get this idea down before refining it...)
                - While `sorted_nums[i + 1] < sum(sorted_nums[i:j])` and `j < len(nums)`:  (note: this isn't quite right, but the idea is to do something like "while the next length $k$ subset is still greater than length $k + 1$ subsets, keep checking length $k + 1$ subsets until they're exhausted.  Then move on to $k + 2$ subsets, and so on.  Once we exceed the next length $k$ subset's sum, we can stop enumerating and add the next length $k$ subset to the list.
                    - I'm thinking we should probably do this in a queue ðŸ¤”...
- How might enumerating subsets in a queue work?
    - Let's start by enqueing every item in the sorted list (`sorted_nums`), along with its position
    - To generate the next subset, we might do something like:
        - Pop the first subset in the queue (`q1`).  Let's call it `x1`.
        - Start a new queue (`q2`) where we explore adding each possible remaining item (after the last element of the popped subset, `x1`) to the popped subset
        - Now, while `q2` isn't empty:
            - Pop the first element in `q2`.  Let's call it `x2`.
            - If the sum for `x2` is greater than for the (new) first subset in `q1`, break (note: and...somehow enque...the item before `x2`?  Something....in `q1`...?)
            - Otherwise enque (in `q2`) new subsets comprising `x2` plus each possible element in `sorted_nums` that comes after the last item's position in `x2`.
    - This isn't quite right...but maybe on the right track?
    - Let's put this aside for the moment.  Let's assume we have a to-be-written function that will give us the "next" subset in the sequence.  And...somehow it's written in an efficient way.  Maybe as a generator?
        - The "simple" approach would be to generate `left - 1` subsets using this function
            - Then once we get to the `left`th subset, we start aggregating the sums, until we get to the `right`th subset.  Then we return the aggregated sum.
        - A more efficient approach, if it were possible, would be to "jump ahead" somehow.  E.g., this would be possible if we could somehow know in advance what the `left`th subset was, without enumerating the previous subsets, and then start our aggregation process there.
            - One thing I can think of is that we *could* do this jumping ahead if we knew that all length $k$ subsets had smaller sums than any length $k + 1$ subsets.  If we wanted to skip ahead to index `i`, then we know that the first $n$ subsets are of length 1, the next $n - 1$ subsets are of length 2, the next $n - 2$ subsets are of length 3, and so on.
            - So the number of subsets with length less than or equal to $k$ is:
                - $(n + 0) + (n + 1) + (n + 2) + ... + (n + k - 1)$.  There are $k$ "$n$s" in this sequence, plus the numbers $0 ... k - 1$.  So if we add those up we get...
                - $kn + $ the sum of the numbers from 0 to $k - 1$, which is $\frac{k^2 - k}{2}$... so in summary, there are $kn + \frac{k^2 - k}{2}$ subsets of (up to) length $k$.
                - This means that, to figure out where index $i$ is in the sequence, we could just figure out the value of $k$ for which the number of subsets of up to length $k$ is greater than $i$, but the number of subsets of length $k - 1$ is *less* than $i$.  Then the $i^\mathrm{th}$ subset can be found by skipping over the first $i - (k - 1)n + \frac{(k - 1)^2 - k + 1}{2}$ subsets of length less than or equal to $k$ (which will include some number of subsets of length $k$ at the end).  I'm not sure that this will help us...but... ðŸ¤·

## Refining the problem, round 2 thoughts
- I think I'm stuck.  So what I'm going to try is:
    - I'll implement the "naive" solution that I outlined above
    - I'll test it to make sure it works on the given test problems and some other made-up examples
    - I'll submit it
    - If the code times out, I'll need to refine the approach and think of something more efficient
 
## Attempted solution(s)
```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        mod = 10**9 + 7

        sums = []
        for i in range(n):
            x = 0
            for j in range(i, n):
                x += nums[j]
                sums.append(x)

        sums.sort()
        return sum(sums[left - 1:right]) % mod
```
- Given test cases pass
